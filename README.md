# wire-pod

`wire-pod` is fully-featured server software for the Digital Dream Labs [Vector](https://www.digitaldreamlabs.com/pages/meet-vector) robot. It was created thanks to Digital Dream Labs' [open-sourced code](https://github.com/digital-dream-labs), and is primarily based on [chipper](https://github.com/digital-dream-labs/chipper).

It allows voice commands to work with any Vector 1.0 or 2.0 for no fee, including regular production robots. Not just with OSKR/dev-unlocked robots.
